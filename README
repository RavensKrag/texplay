INSTRUCTIONS 

* version: 0.1.9.0 BETA

To compile TexPlay first run extconf.rb
=> ruby extconf.rb

Then type 'make' (or nmake for windows):
=> make

If all goes well, run the example program:
=> ruby test.rb

*like any gosu application, gosu.so must be in the current directory (or the gosu gem installed) when running the examples.

Enjoy!
(note that TexPlay has only been tested on 32 bit linux systems and WindowsXP using VS 6.0)
