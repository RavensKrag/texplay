*an image manipulation tool for ruby and gosu*

INSTRUCTIONS 
============

**TexPlay version 0.2.4**

Gem installation:

+ sudo gem install texplay

To compile TexPlay from source, ensure you are in the directory with the Rakefile and type:

+ rake

OR

+ rake19  (assuming this is the name of your 1.9.1 version of rake)

**NB:** be sure to run the version of rake that corresponds to the ruby version you wish to use! on my system I use rake19 for ruby 1.9.1!

If all goes well, run the example programs:

+ cd examples
+ ruby example_melt.rb
+ ruby example_simple.rb
+ ..etc

+ like any gosu application, gosu.so must be in the current directory (or the gosu gem installed) when running the examples.

Enjoy!
